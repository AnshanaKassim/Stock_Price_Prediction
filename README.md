# Stock Price Prediction with ARIMA, RNN, LSTM, and Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains code for my MSc project on stock price prediction using ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM models. It includes data preprocessing, model development, and the integration of Twitter sentiment analysis. The project aims to enhance predictive accuracy for Apple Inc. stock prices. All code and data are shared for reproducibility.

## Features 
Models: ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). 

Sentiment Analysis: Incorporation of Twitter sentiment data to improve prediction accuracy. 

Data: Historical stock prices and Twitter sentiment data from 2015-2019.

## Getting Started 
To start this project using Google Colab, follow the steps below: 
1. Open the Notebooks in Google Colab: Open each .ipynb file in Google Colab by clicking on the notebook file and selecting the "Open in Colab" button.
2. Load Data: The notebooks are designed to load the necessary CSV files directly from this repository. Ensure the CSV files are available in the correct path as specified in the notebooks.
3. Run the Notebooks: In Google Colab, execute the cells in each notebook sequentially. The notebooks include steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results Summary 
Best Performance: The LSTM model provided the most accurate predictions. 

Impact of Sentiment Analysis: Adding Twitter sentiment had a modest impact on prediction accuracy.
