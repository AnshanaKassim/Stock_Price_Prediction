# Stock_Price_Prediction
This repository contains code for my MSc project on stock price prediction using ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM models. It includes data preprocessing, model development, and the integration of Twitter sentiment analysis. The project aims to enhance predictive accuracy for Apple Inc. stock prices. All code and data are shared for reproducibility.
